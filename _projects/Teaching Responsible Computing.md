## Project Overview
Computing is ubiquitous in our daily lives. Increasingly computing makes decisions in our lives starting from the mundane (e.g. Netflix recommending  us movies/TV shows), to the somewhat more relevant (e.g. algorithms deciding which ads Google shows you) to the downright worrisome (e.g. automated systems deciding the risk of a person who is arrested committing a crime in the future). 

While we have (and continue to) educate our computing students on the  technical aspects of building computing systems that are used in our daily lives, there has been relatively less focus on incorporating ethics and responsible computing in such courses. Our project aims to incorporate ethics and more generally responsible computing in a wide range of computing courses.

While most of our work in this project has been in incorporating responsible computing in our [courses](#courses), we have also created [grading rubric](#rubric) for ethical/responsible computing related assignments.

## <a name="courses">Courses

We have currently targeted a mix of courses: three required courses (spanning the first year, sophomore and senior year) for the BS Computer Science degree, one popular elective and created one new elective. Here is a quick overview of the courses that we targeted:

- _Required courses_
    - First year seminar ([CSE 199](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/ahunt/classes/internet/)): Module on history, society and diversity and module on social media and machine learning were targeted. Each module is a two week long combination of lectures and in-class activities. CSE 199 is required for BS Computer Science and BS Computer Engineering programs.
    - Algorithms course ([CSE 331](http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/cse331/fall19/index.html)): Homework assignments and a project based on access to high-speed Internet in WNY were introduced. CSE 331 is required for the BS Computer Science program.
    - Capstone course ([CSE 442](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~mhertz/2019fall/cse442/)): Students review a made-up dossier of government data to identify if an individual should be added to the governmentâ€™s No-Fly list. Students must then discuss biases in the data provided and, finally, how they would respond if their job assigned them to the team automating this analysis.  A second assignment asks students to document the ethical implications of the capstone project they chose. CSE 442 is the capstone course for the BS Computer Science program.
- _Existing elective_
    - Machine learning course ([CSE 474](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~chandola/machinelearning.html)): Students worked in a group project exploring bias in data driven criminal risk assessment
- _New course_
    - [Algorithms and Society](http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/algo-and-society/spr20/index.html): Course that had separate sections for CSE and non-CSE majors (but seated in the same room). The goal was to give non-CSE students a non-trivial understanding of various stages of the ML pipeline and for CSE students to get a deep dive into societal implications of machine learning systems. The class was a mix of lectures and discussions.

Next, we provide bit more details on the ethical and/or responsible computing assignments that we created as part of our existing courses:

### First year seminar (CSE 199)

### Algorithms course (CSE 331)

There are multiple activities/assignments in CSE 331 that all have the common thread of accessing high speed Internet. The main reason for this choice was because this is an issue all of our students could appreciate at a personal level. COVID hit _after_ we implemented/ran these activities in Fall 2019. In future iterations we plan to incorporate increased awareness of the structural inequalities when it comes to access to high speed Internet (see e.g. this [Netgain Partnership](https://www.netgainpartnership.org/)  webinar on [Broadband Access in the US](https://www.netgainpartnership.org/events/covid19/broadband-access-in-the-us)) that has been brought to the fore by the pandemic.

Below we provide an overview of four activities/assignments that we piloted in Fall 2019 

#### In class discussion on improving broadband access in WNY

The introductory lecture asks students to think about how they would improve broadband access in [Cattaraugus county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattaraugus_County,_New_York) (which is one county over from [Erie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_County,_New_York), which is where [Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York) resides). Students are asked to talk in small groups in the lecture to think about both technical as well as societal issues as they think about how to solve the whole problem. 

This in-class activity on improving Internet access in Cattaraugus county was an activity that was used in CSE 331 before Fall 2019 though the focus was mostly on the technical aspects. Starting in Fall 2019, students were explicitly asked to think about societal issues as well.

[This related talk]({{ site.url | append: "talks/Incorporating Societal Context in an UG Algorithms course.html" }}) provides more details on this in-class activity including some of the in-class responses.


#### Greedy algorithm problem

#### Dynamic programming problem

#### Coding project


### Capstone course (CSE 442)

### Machine learning course (CSE 474)
