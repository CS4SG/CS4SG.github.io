## Mission 

The Impossible Project is a learning experience that prepares students to take on grand challenges by teaching them to BEND: _Build_ collective resilience, _Enhance_ creative critical thinking, _Nurture_ collaboration and _Discover_ purpose through dedication to social and planetary good. 

## Learning Objectives: B.E.N.D.

### Build Collective Resilience 

The Impossible Project challenges students to fail together from day one and to recognize early that failure is nothing more than a new beginning&#46; By eliminating the pressure of individual success&#47;failure and positing collective success&#47;failure as the central mode&#44; the Impossible Project encourages students become more resilient and more daring&#46; 

### Enhance Creative Critical Thinking 

Unafraid to fail&#44; students participating in the Impossible Project are freed to embrace the kind of creativity and criticality that requires an openness of heart and mind and a tolerance for the kind of cognitive dissonance that can lead to growth&#46; The impossible project clears the way for true creative critical thinking.

### Nurture True Collaboration 

The Impossible Project emphasizes true collaboration by offering students the opportunity to build not only flexible&#44; agile and resilient teams&#44; but also the unity of purpose&#44; identity and dedication necessary for longer&#45;term and justice&#45;oriented collaborative work&#46; Collaboration in this model is seen less as a skill to be employed and more as a way of living&#44; working and engaging with the world&#46; 

### Discover Purpose 

Students who learn to work together in true&#44; meaningful collaboration&#44; who can tap into a well of bold&#44; border&#45;defying and generative creativity&#44; and who are brave enough to fail together will be well&#45;positioned to discover their purpose as members of a global community who are capable of advancing social and planetary good&#46;

### Talks

I offer a 1&#48; minutes &#40;for panels&#41;&#44; 3&#48; minute and 6&#48; minute &#40;interactive&#41; presentations on the Impossible Project &#40;IP&#41; as a mode&#44; philosophy&#44; theory and practice of teaching and learning&#46; Topics included in my talks are&#58; a description of the IP learning philosophy and its origins&#59; an explanation of core IP principles&#44; concepts and learning objectives&#59; and&#44; the power of the IP to support diversity&#44; equity and inclusion work&#46; Participants will come away with a new perspective on critical teaching practice&#44; new ideas for course development&#44;  a new understanding of assessment and its potential&#44; and a renewed commitment to DEI in their classrooms&#46; 

### Trainings 

IP trainings are for educators&#46; They are structured as week&#45;long in&#45;person or remote group events&#46; Trainings invite participants to discuss their own teaching experience&#44; practice and philosophy&#59; to engage in group discussions of critical&#44; innovative and inclusive pedagogies&#59; to refashion a chosen course using IP core concepts and objectives&#44; and to reconsider and realign their course assessments to reflect new objectives&#46; 

### Workshops 

IP workshops prepare educators to run a one&#45;week IP experience with undergraduate or graduate level university students within or across disciplines&#46; Educators determine the impossible project the students will undertake and are trained and supported to build and run the program themselves&#46; Educators are invited to pilot test the project themselves as part of the program&#46; &#40;requires 1&#45;2 months of preparation&#41;&#46; 

### Course [Re]design 

The course &#91;re&#93;design program is a year&#45;long experience where an IP expert works with an individual or team of faculty members on the &#91;re&#93;design of an entire course&#44; or a significant component of a course&#46; This program includes all the elements of IP training for educators&#59; continuous idea building&#47;research support&#59; guidance through pilot testing&#44; assessment and retooling&#59; and&#44; support for building a sustainable and scalable model to achieve maximum impact in and beyond home department&#46;  &#40;This is a year&#45;long commitment&#41;

### One-to-one faculty consultations

One&#45;on&#45;one faculty&#45;to&#45;faculty consultations are mini trainings meant to reinvigorate faculty members who wish to update&#44; radicalize&#44; re&#45;envision their teaching practice and could use support&#47;inspiration in the process&#46;  Participants are invited to share their research and their teaching goals&#44; discuss pedagogical approaches&#44; and develop a series of action steps for shifting their practice to support diversity&#44; equity&#44; inclusion and social&#47;planetary justice&#46; &#40;3 hours&#46; Shared readings provided&#41;&#10;
