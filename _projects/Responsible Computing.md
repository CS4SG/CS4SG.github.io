# Project Overview
<p>Computing is ubiquitous in our daily lives. Increasingly computing makes decisions in our lives <span style="color: black;">starting from the mundane (e.g. Netflix</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">recommending us movies/TV shows), to the somewhat more relevant (e.g. algorithms deciding which ads Google shows you) to the downright worrisome</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">(e.g. automated systems deciding the risk of a person who is arrested committing a crime in the future). </span></p><p><br></p><p>While we have (and continue to) educate our computing students on the technical aspects of building computing systems that are used in our daily lives, there has been relatively less focus on incorporating ethics and responsible computing in such courses. Our project aims to incorporate ethics and more generally responsible computing in a wide range of computing course.</p>
