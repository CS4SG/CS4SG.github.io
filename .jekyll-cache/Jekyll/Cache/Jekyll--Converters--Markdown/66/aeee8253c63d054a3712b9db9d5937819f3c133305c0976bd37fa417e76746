I"é<p>In this talk, I will share four key experiences that shaped my approach to transformative pedagogy and explain how these experiences led to the development of the Impossible Project (IP). After briefly describing the project and four ongoing IP collaborations that span k-12 education, computer science, business and the arts, I will then discuss outcomes and assessment for transformative education. This talk concludes with a reflection on what it takes to teach for social good.</p>
