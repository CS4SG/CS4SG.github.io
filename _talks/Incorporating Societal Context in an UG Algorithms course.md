The mock-class <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rjgIlrsNWyoq305NJxNQKbkTy-sTceiD" target="_blank">showcases activities </a>from the undergraduate algorithms course related to high speed Internet access. The first activity would be an in-class exercise where students think about the technical and ethical issues related to increasing  access to the Internet in a Western New York county. Follow-up assignments include a video and coding project where students go through various routing problems related to working for a high-speed internet service provider.
