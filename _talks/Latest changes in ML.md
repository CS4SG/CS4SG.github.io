<p>The purpose of&nbsp;<a href="https://patternbasedwriting.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><strong>Pattern Based Writing: Quick &amp; Easy Essay</strong></a>&nbsp;is to quickly and easily teach students how to organize information and make points clear. Then in the&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(18, 88, 210); background-color: transparent;">Writing with Purpose</strong>&nbsp;section of the writing program, students learn to apply their new writing strategies to different types, kinds, genres, and modes of writing. The truth is that it’s&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(18, 88, 210); background-color: transparent;">quick</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(18, 88, 210); background-color: transparent;">easy</strong>&nbsp;to get students to write many different types of paragraphs when they have the right foundation.</p><p><br></p><h2>Put simply, all of the different types and kinds of paragraphs simply involve layering on a different purpose or intent. When students have the right foundation, it’s just that simple. What are you trying to achieve in this paragraph and in your whole composition? What is your purpose right here? Do you wish to describe? Do you want to evaluate? Is your goal to narrate? Is your intent to persuade?</h2><p><br></p>
