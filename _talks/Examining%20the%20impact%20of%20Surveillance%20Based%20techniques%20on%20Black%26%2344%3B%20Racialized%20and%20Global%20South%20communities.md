key: Examining the impact of Surveillance Based techniques on Black&#44; Racialized and Global South communities
---

While surveillance&#45;based business models are deployed globally affecting billions in the global south&#44; Surveillance capitalism and Surveillance&#45;based technology are often studied from a US and Western context&#46; This results in the negative effects of surveillance&#45;based technology on racialized and global south communities not being widely understood&#46; Additionally the solutions designed in the North are unlikely to work without localization as there are economic&#44; political and social differences in the South absent in the North&#46; This talk will use Sub&#45;Saharan Africa and the experience of &#8220;Blackness&#8221; as a microcosm of the commodification and dehumanization of humanity in general&#46;
